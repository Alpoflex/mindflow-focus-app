# MindFlow

Focus. Create. Breathe.

A minimal Pomodoro timer that doesn't get in your way.

## The Idea

Most productivity apps are overwhelming. Too many features, too many notifications, too much noise.

MindFlow is different:
- **25-minute focus sessions**
- **5-minute breaks**
- **Ambient sounds** (optional)
- **Nothing else**

## Usage

```bash
npm install && npm run dev
```

Press start. Work. That's it.

## Design Philosophy

- Glassmorphic UI
- Dark mode only
- No accounts, no tracking
- No distractions

Built for people who just want to focus.
